Develop this as an engine plugin (for Unity or UE4).
Phase 1: Grey Box: Have the plugin generate the geometry of a level
(given certain parameters chosen by the end-user).
Phase 2: Textures: Following on from the first phase, apply textures to this
geometric formation (consider the parameters, UV maps etc.)
Phase 3: (If there is time for such) Props: Distribute appropriate props
around the level area (as per the parameters provided). 

Also consider Modular (where the user would have to import a module set
of objects for this tool to use) vs Generic (where only using a set of
primitive shapes, the tool is able to generate the level) implementation
for this tool.

Bonus Phase: (If there is time) Collisions: For the geometry 
in the level.
